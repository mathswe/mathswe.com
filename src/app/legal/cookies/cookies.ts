    These enhance the website or web app performance as certain functions may
    not be available without them. They allow users to remember their
    preferences and settings, provide a personalized user experience, are

    not track browsing activity across other websites. For example, cookies
    that remember user location, chosen language, or other settings, a live web

    These cookies collect data on how users interact with the website or web

    These are used to identify visitors between different websites and may be
    used by companies to build a profile of visitor interests or show relevant
    ads on other websites, and are usually third-party. They are used on a

    websites or web apps. For example, cookies installed by YouTube in videos
    embedded into our site to track their views and user preferences.
